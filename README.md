# High-resolution groundwater pumping estimation for the Western United States using satellite datasets and deep learning

Following the data-drive approach of estimating effective precipitation and consumptive groundwater use for the Western US, this research project focues on quatifying groundwater pumping for irrigation for the region. The porject employs a deep learning technique, called transfer learning, to first train a model (pre-trained model) on the consumptive groundwater use dataset. Then, the pre-trained model is fine tuned with available in-situ pumping records to generate Western US-wide grounwater pumping estimates for the irrigated agriculture at 2 km spatial resolution.
